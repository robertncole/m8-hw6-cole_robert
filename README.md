I am having some trouble understanding this. I couldnt get the site to work. I am not sure if my error is in the javascrtip because when I change the opacity in the css, a random option does show up. So maybe my issue is the css transtion? I am still catching up so unless I am just missing just a bracket or something, maybe we could schedule a 1 on 1.

I used a lot of w3schools article to help as my resources.
